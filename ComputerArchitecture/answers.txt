1. Which lines of code correspond to the for loop of foo?
Lines 16-24 corresponds to the loop comparing the value of i to the buffer size and checking if the loop should continue.
Lines 12-15 corresponds to the action inside of the forloop setting B[i] = 5, and incrementing i.

2. Which register is used to hold the variable i of foo?
DWORD PTR [ebp-4] holds i, which we then send to the eax register.

3. What is the memory address of the variable i of foo?
[ebp-4]

4. What is the beginning address of array B?
[ebp-56+eax*4] with eax = i initially being 1 so, [ebp-56+4] = [ebp-60]

5. What is the addressing mode for the constant BUF_SIZE when it is used as loop bound?
Immediate addressing mode

6. What is the addressing mode for the constant 5?
Immediate addressing mode

7. What is the addressing mode used to access each element of B in the loop?
Indexed addressing mode

8. What does the code on line 9 (“sub esp, 64”) do?
Here we are making space (64 bytes) on the stack for the program to use and store variables.
