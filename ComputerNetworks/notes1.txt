Slide 100, chapter 3

1 - (total recieved/total sent)

Computing RTT 


does loss affect RTT calc? No

RTT computed from recieve size.
RTT measured in milliseconds.

HW6: only client program

 Is the average RTT a good measure in itself or would some other statistical quantity make it easier to
interpret?
avg RTT may take some random paths.

 Does the RTT say anything about the One-way Trip times (OWTT)?
 Can you think of key network parameter you could estimate by measuring the change in the temporal
spacing between the sent segments and the received segments?
 What happens if you send datagrams as fast as possible? Can you create loss even using the lossless
server? How should you modify your code in this situation? (see suggested control flow below)
