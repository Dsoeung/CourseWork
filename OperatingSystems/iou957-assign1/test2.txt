First, the program needs to determine the number of files to be processed. 
This can be done with the argc parameter of the main function; 
Then, the argv parameter can be used to retrieve the name for each file.
After that, fork() system call will be used to create multiple processes (one for each file). 
For each child process, 
it can simply invoke a function to count the number of words inside a specific file and print out the result like:
Child process for File_x: number of words is XXX
