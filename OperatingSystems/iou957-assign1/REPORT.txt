1. List all of the people that you have collaborated with on this assignment. For each person indicate the level of collaboration (small, medium, large). Also write a few sentences describing what was discussed. Indicate whether you were mainly giving help or receiving help.
I worked on the majority of it alone, however I had help from an friend, Aldo. 
Who refresh me on how fork works and the wait block, I'd say that's a small collaboration.

2. Do you think everything you did is correct? .....
In function I think so, however definitely not optimally, I'm still not used to forks, and
I don't think I error checked it right.

3. If not, give a brief description of what is working and what progress was made on the part that is not working.
Everything, to my knowledge this time, is working as per instruction.

4. Comments (e.g., what were the challenges, how to make this assignment more interesting etc.):
Again I'm still not as used to forks as I want to be I got help on this program so that would be the challenge for me.
