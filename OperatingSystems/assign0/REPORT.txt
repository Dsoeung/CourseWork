1. List all of the people that you have collaborated with on this assignment. For each person indicate the level of collaboration (small, medium, large).
Also write a few sentences describing what was discussed. Indicate whether you were mainly giving help or receiving help.
   
   I wrote this program with the help of my friend Jason, not present in this class but just a good upperclassman,
   he helped me with driver2 cause I had trouble wrapping my head around it.
   I researched a lot about small stuff to deal with moving characters around and character arrays.

2. Do you think everything you did is correct? .....
	Correct in functionality but in efficiency definitely not, initially when I tried to tackle the functions in part I, I overthought about 80% of it.
	the drivers also were pretty hard for me to wrap my head around especially driver2.

3. If not, give a brief description of what is working and what progress was made on the part that is not working.
	All is working except if you go below -9999 on choosing all the integers and doubles cause I didn't know which
	minimum value to take.

4. Comments (e.g., what were the challenges, how to make this assignment more interesting etc.):
	Specifically when finding and comparing the largest line/integer/double I didn't know what to set the initial value of the max.
	I knew it had to be low however I could not default to 0 as negative numbers where possible in all except in lines.
	I also don't know how to make the positive sign appear in numbers, although the negative sign shows no problems appearing.
